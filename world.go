	        # eliminates all units
	    # Tick: advances world clock by 1, executes all cycle functions sequentially in registration order
	    # NewActor: creates a new actor
	        # return: unit id of actor
	        # return: list of atomic action interfaces provided by the world
	        # return: an action response to communicate outcome of invoking an action interface
	    # Register: registers a cycle function
	        # all registered cycle functions will be executed per tick
	    # Look: an actor looks, receiving a collection of images
	        # id: id of the actor that looks
	        # return: list of images the actor sees
	    # Cmd: used to enable implementation-specific commands per world
